FairChem property calculator.


Uses FairChem machine learning models to compute materials properties
like bulk modulus and heat capacity.

This is a simplified implementation. For full functionality:
1. Install FairChem package
2. Configure conda environment
3. Set up elastic.py and phonon.py prediction scripts

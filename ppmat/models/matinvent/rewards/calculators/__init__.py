Property calculators for reward system.

Available calculators:
- PyMatGen: Crystal density, HHI score, element price, crustal abundance
- SynScore: Synthesizability score prediction (requires model files)
- DFTCalc: DFT calculations (band gap, formation energy, etc.)
- FairChem: ML-based properties (bulk modulus, heat capacity)
